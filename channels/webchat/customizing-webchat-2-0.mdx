## Comprehensive Guide for Customizing Your Webchat

### Introduction

Chatbot Builder Webchat allows you to easily integrate a chatbot on your website without needing third-party platforms. This guide will help you set up and customize your webchat, including changing the chat bubble icon and controlling its size, with easy-to-follow steps for non-coders and beginners.

### Embedding the Webchat Code Into Your Website

#### Steps to Embed Webchat

1. **Navigate to Settings** (inside your CBB account)
   - Go to Settings > Channels > Web Chatbot > Manage inside your CBB account.
2. **Add Authorized Websites** (inside the Manage Webchat section)
   - Inside the manage webchat section, add your website domain or subdomain to the authorized websites list. The chatbot will only load on these authorized sites.
3. **Get the Webchat Code** (inside the Manage Webchat section)
   - After creating and saving your webchat inside your CBB account, click the three dots in the manage webchat section to get the code.
4. **Insert the Code into Your Website**
   - **Warning**: Always ensure that both IDs (`your-webchat-id` and `your-account-id`) provided in the webchat section are included in the script.

   Example code to insert:

   ```html
   <script src="https://app.chatgptbuilder.io/webchat/plugin.js?v=5"></script>
   <script>
       ktt10.setup({
           id: "your-webchat-id",  // webchat id
           accountid: "your-account-id",  // account id
           color: "#36d6b5"
       });
   </script>
   ```

   This code will embed the webchat on your website, ensuring proper functionality with both required IDs.

### Open the Webchat After a Defined Time (Timeout)

Example code:

```html
<script src="https://app.chatgptbuilder.io/webchat/plugin.js"></script>
<script>
    ktt10.setup({
        id: "your_webchat_id",  // this is your webchat id
        accountid: "your_account_id",  // this is your account id
        color: "#36d6b5"
    });
    setTimeout(function() {
        ktt10btn.click();
    }, 3000);  // automatically open after 3 seconds
</script>
