This feature allows users to integrate external JSON data into their chatbot flows. The "Get Data from JSON" action lets the chatbot retrieve data from a specified JSON source and utilize that data within the chatbot's conversation flow.

### Real-World Use Case: Real-Time Product Availability

An e-commerce business can use this feature to provide real-time product availability and details to their customers.

For instance, an online retail store's chatbot could pull product data from a JSON API provided by the store's inventory system. When a user inquires about a specific product, the chatbot can dynamically fetch and display the current stock status, price, and other details using the "Get Data from JSON" action.

This ensures that the information provided is accurate and up-to-date.

        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Configure the JSON Source**
        
        Specify the JSON data source (e.g., a URL to the e-commerce API endpoint) and define the JSON path to extract the required product information.

          alt="Configure JSON Source"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Map the Data**
        
        Map the extracted JSON data to custom fields in the chatbot, which can then be used in messages or further logic.

          alt="Map JSON Data to Custom Fields"
        />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Handle Success and Failure**
        
        Define the chatbot's response for successful data retrieval and any fallback actions in case of failure.

          alt="Handle Success and Failure"
        />
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Implementation Example:

1.  **User Inquiry:** A customer asks the chatbot, "Is the XYZ smartwatch available?"
2.  **Data Retrieval:** The chatbot uses the "Get Data from JSON" action to fetch the latest data from the store's inventory system.
3.  **Response:** The chatbot responds, "The XYZ smartwatch is currently in stock for $199. Would you like to add it to your cart?"

This feature allows e-commerce chatbots to be more dynamic and responsive by leveraging external data sources, enhancing user interaction with timely and relevant product information.
