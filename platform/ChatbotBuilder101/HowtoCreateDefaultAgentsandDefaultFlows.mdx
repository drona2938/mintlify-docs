### How to Create a Default Flow for Your AI Chatbot

After setting up a welcome message, the next essential component of your AI chatbot is the **Default Flow**. The Default Flow ensures that whenever a user asks a question outside the context of a specific flow, your bot can respond intelligently and consistently. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through creating a Default Flow, customizing its prompts, and integrating various technologies like Agents, Assistants, Dialogflow, traditional chatbot logic, or a hybrid mix to enhance your bot’s responsiveness.

#### Step 1: Understand the Default Flow vs. Default Agent and Assistant

Before diving into creating a Default Flow, it's crucial to understand the differences between **Default Flow**, **Default Agent**, and **Default Assistant**:

##### When to Use Each

- **Default Flow:** Use If: You need interactive elements (media/buttons) and complete control over fallback responses.

      ```
    - **Example Scenarios:**
      - **User:** "Do you have pepperoni pizza?"
