This feature enables the seamless transition of a conversation between the bot and a human. In simpler terms, it allows you to toggle between live chat and bot interaction. When a conversation is transferred to a human, it is exclusively handled by a human agent, with the bot temporarily disabled to ensure a personalized touch.

You can transfer a conversation to a human or a bot from the following locations:

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Inbox">
        You can directly transfer a conversation to a human or bot from the inbox while you are chatting with a user.
    </Card>

        You can also transfer conversations for one or multiple users from the contacts section.
    </Card>
     <Card title="Flow Builder">
        You can transfer conversations to a human or bot at any point in your chat flow.
