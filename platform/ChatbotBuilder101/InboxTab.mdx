### 2. Dashboard Link

Clicking the First section of this part (the three lines marked above) will redirect you to your dashboard.

### 3. Conversation Filters

In the second section, you can choose between **All conversations**, **Conversations assigned to the bot**, and **Conversations assigned to humans**. This determines the messages you see in your inbox depending on whether they are being handled by humans or your bot.
