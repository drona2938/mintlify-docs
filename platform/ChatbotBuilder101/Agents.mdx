### Overview

Agents are custom instructions for LLM prompts that enhance your chatbot’s capabilities, building on OpenAI’s latest **SWARM** framework.

By using Agents, you can create adaptable and context-rich conversations within Default Agent (Formerly Auto-GPT) or Flow Builder. Each Agent allows you to set precise instructions that guide the LLM to ensure accurate and on-brand responses.

### Setting Up Agents

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Navigate to Integrations**
        
        Go to **Settings > Integrations > LLM** and select the language model of your choice.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **View and Manage Agents**
        
        Here, you’ll find a list of your existing Agents. You can add a new Agent or edit an existing one. Each Agent has a customizable Prompt field where you can input specific instructions that will guide the LLM’s behavior.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Define Custom Instructions**
        
        Inside each Agent setup, you’ll find a text field for **Prompt** (custom instructions). Use this field to define the guidelines the LLM should follow for this specific Agent, allowing for a high degree of customization.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Unlimited User and Bot Messages**
        
        You can set up a sequence of user and bot messages, ensuring these accompany every API call. This feature lets you create a structured context that the Agent uses consistently, ensuring accuracy and alignment with user interactions.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Using Functions with Agents**
        
        You can integrate Functions within your Agent. Functions provide added flexibility, allowing Agents to retrieve data, execute tasks, or calculate values within the conversation. Functions can be enabled in both Default Agent (Formerly Auto-GPT) and Flow Builder.
    </Step>
</Steps>
