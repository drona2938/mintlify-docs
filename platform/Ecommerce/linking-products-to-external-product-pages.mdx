  <Card title="External Checkout">
    When users decide to purchase, they will be redirected to the external product page on your website where the transaction will be completed.

</CardGroup>

### Benefits

  <Card title="Seamless Integration">
    The bot makes it super easy to show products and let people buy them directly from the chat interface.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Third-Party Handling">
    This setup works great for businesses that utilize third-party services for printing and shipping, as the chatbot handles the product display while the actual purchase and fulfillment are managed externally.

### Example

Imagine you are selling a “Prompt Engineer Cap.” You set up the product in the dashboard, and users can view it in the chat. When they click to purchase, they are taken to your website’s product page to complete the transaction.

  This new feature enhances the user experience by providing a smooth transition from Browse to buying, leveraging the capabilities of both the chatbot and your website.
