Webshop allows your customers to easily place orders online.
The webshop works on all channels. No matter if your customers use Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram… they can buy from your business.

Setting up a webshop is very easy. Go to **Tools \> Ecommerce** and add your products. After that, follow the instructions below.

To let your customers access your web shop, use the system field `{{shop_link}}` as a button URL for channels that support buttons like Messenger or Telegram.

For channels that don’t support buttons like SMS or WhatsApp, you can use the `{{shop_link}}` inside a text block like the image below.
