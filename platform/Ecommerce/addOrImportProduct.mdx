### Import Products from .CSV with External Checkout Links

In Chatbot Builder AI, you can easily import products into your chatbot using a .CSV file. This feature allows you to add multiple products, each with an external checkout link. The chatbot will use this data to recommend products or direct users to the external checkout page.

#### CSV Format Requirements

Your .CSV file must include the following headers, formatted exactly as shown:

- **Name:** The product name.
- **Price:** The product price (e.g., 29.99).
- **Category:** The product category (e.g., Electronics, Apparel).
- **Short Description:** A brief description of the product (e.g., “High-quality wireless headphones”).
- **Image:** The URL of the product image.
- **Link:** The external checkout link.

**Example CSV:**

```csv
Name,Price,Category,Short Description,Image,Link
Wireless Headphones,49.99,Electronics,High-quality wireless headphones,[http://imageurl.com/headphones,http://checkouturl.com/headphones](http://imageurl.com/headphones,http://checkouturl.com/headphones)
Smart Watch,99.99,Accessories,Stylish smartwatch with health tracking,[http://imageurl.com/smartwatch,http://checkouturl.com/smartwatch](http://imageurl.com/smartwatch,http://checkouturl.com/smartwatch)
```

#### Importing Process:

These products will now be available for chatbot recommendations, allowing users to follow the external checkout links to complete their purchases.
