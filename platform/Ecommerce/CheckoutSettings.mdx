### In this checkout settings:

<Accordion title="Checkout">
  This setting determines the final step of your customers' orders. For Shopify stores, this setting is fixed, utilizing the default checkout page. However, if you prefer users to complete orders outside of Messenger, such as on your website or Amazon, avoid using our default checkout page. This provides flexibility for varied checkout experiences based on your business needs.

  The maximum number of different vendors that are allowed in a single shopping cart. Give “-1” if the number of vendors in the cart is unlimited or no-limit.
