Setting delivery costs based on location is a straightforward process within our platform, taking only minutes to configure diverse delivery costs for various locations.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Create a Google Sheet or Microsoft Excel Document.**
        
        Download the Google Sheets template [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_9Z_0_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z_z/edit?usp=sharing)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Fill-in Details:**
        -   In the country column, use **ISO Alpha-2 codes** (e.g., "US" for the United States, "FR" for France).
        -   There are no specific restrictions for state, city, and address columns.

    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Configure Delivery Costs:**
        
        Set different delivery costs for various states, cities, or addresses for multiple products.
    </Step>
</Steps>

This streamlined process ensures precise control over delivery costs, enhancing your **eCommerce** customization.

Customize delivery charges effortlessly based on location with our platform. For 'state-specific' charges, leave **city and address** cells **empty**; for 'city-specific' charges, leave address cells empty. The image below provides a sample guide to implementing diverse delivery costs for different states.

<Note>
    In the "Price" column, exclude currency symbols and spaces. Enter values directly; for instance, if the cost is 1,000.5 USD, simply input `1000.5` for seamless integration and accurate pricing.
</Note>

No need to re-enter the currency symbol; it's already chosen in the eCommerce settings.

After entering your data in the file, export it as a CSV. Then, in **Marketing > eCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Delivery cost**, click "Set cost per location" for seamless configuration.

<Info>
    Remember, each new file upload overwrites the old pricing.
    <br />
    To reset a flat rate cost, upload a new file without any data. This ensures a clean slate for your pricing structure.
