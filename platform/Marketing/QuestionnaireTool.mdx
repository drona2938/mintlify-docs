### Step-by-Step Guide

    **Designing the Post-Questionnaire Flow**

    Before creating the questionnaire itself, it's essential to design the flow your users will experience once they complete the survey. This flow will determine the messages or actions your chatbot will take after receiving the questionnaire responses.

    1. **Go to Flows:** Navigate to the "Flows" section in your Chatbot Builder AI dashboard.
    2. **Add a New Flow:** Click on "Add" to create a new flow.
    3. **Name the Flow:** Give the flow a descriptive name, such as "Post-Questionnaire Flow."
    4. **Add Content:** Click on the block within the flow and select "Add Content Type."
    5. **Create Message:** Compose a message you want to send users after completing the questionnaire.
    6. **Publish the Flow:** Once you're satisfied with the message, publish it to make it active.
