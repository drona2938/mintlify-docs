<Warning>
  Important Notice: Complying with Meta's 24-Hour Rule for Drip Campaigns
</Warning>

Meta, the parent company of Facebook Messenger, enforces a 24-hour rule for promotional messaging. This regulation applies to any marketing or promotional messages delivered through Messenger, a core component of Chatbotbuilder.ai.

<Info>
  **Here's the key takeaway:** You can only send promotional messages to users who have interacted with your business within the past 24 hours on Messenger. Interactions include subscribing to your bot, clicking on a button, or initiating a conversation.
</Info>

Failing to comply with this rule can result in limitations on your ability to send messages through Messenger.

### Drip Campaigns

Drip campaigns are a marketing powerhouse, allowing you to nurture leads, engage customers, and ultimately drive conversions. By delivering automated sequences of personalized messages, you can build relationships with your audience and keep your brand top-of-mind.

This guide will equip you with the knowledge to create effective drip campaigns within Chatbotbuilder.ai. We'll walk you through the process step-by-step, from crafting compelling content to scheduling your messages and setting up the all-important subscription flow.

Let's dive in and discover how to leverage drip campaigns to achieve your marketing goals in Chatbotbuilder.ai\!

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Craft Your Compelling Flows**

    Imagine your drip campaign as a series of personalized messages spread over time. Start by designing individual chatbot flows for each stage of your campaign. These flows will contain the content you want to deliver at specific intervals.

    **Here's an example:**

    - **Day 1 Flow:** Welcome new subscribers, introduce your brand, and offer a special discount.
    - **Day 3 Flow:** Provide valuable content related to your niche and highlight a relevant product or service.
    - **Day 7 Flow:** Share customer testimonials or case studies to build trust and encourage conversions.

    Each flow can include text messages, images, buttons, or even interactive elements like quizzes or polls to keep your audience engaged.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Build Your Drip Campaign**

    - Click **Continue** to proceed.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Schedule Your Messages**

    Here's where you define the order and timing of your drip messages:

    - Click on **Message** to design your drip sequence.
    - In this section, you'll define when each message in your campaign will be delivered to your users.
    - Select the flow you want to send first (e.g., "Day 1 Flow") from the dropdown menu.
    - Choose when it should be delivered (e.g., "Immediately").
    - Repeat this step for subsequent messages (Day 2, Day 3, etc.) by selecting the corresponding flows and scheduling their delivery times.

    <Note>
      This setup ensures the Day 1 flow is sent immediately after the user subscribes to the drip campaign. The Day 2 flow is then sent one day after the Day 1 flow, and the Day 3 flow follows one day after the Day 2 flow was sent.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Create a Subscription Flow**

    This flow acts as the entry point for your drip campaign, prompting users to sign up.

    - Design a dedicated flow where users can subscribe.
    - Within this flow, use the **Subscribe to Drip Campaign** action.
    - From the dropdown menu, choose the drip campaign you just created.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Putting it All Together

Once a user interacts with your subscription flow, they'll be automatically enrolled in your drip campaign. The system will then trigger the "Day 1" flow immediately, followed by subsequent flows based on the timings you've set.

By following these steps, you can create automated drip campaigns in Chatbotbuilder.ai to nurture leads, promote products, and deliver valuable content to your users over time.

### Best Practices for Messenger Drip Campaigns

To ensure your drip campaigns adhere to Meta's regulations, consider these best practices:

- Design an engaging subscription flow that encourages users to interact with your bot.
- Segment your audience based on recent interactions and target promotional messages only to those who have opted in within the past 24 hours.
- Provide valuable content and helpful information in your initial messages to build trust and foster continued engagement.

### Expanding Your Reach Beyond Messenger

While Meta's 24-hour rule applies to Facebook Messenger, Chatbotbuilder.ai offers a distinct advantage: **omnichannel marketing**.

By leveraging Chatbotbuilder.ai's integrations with other communication channels like **Telegram, SMS, Email, and Webchat**, you can extend your drip campaign reach beyond the limitations of Messenger's 24-hour window.

This allows you to nurture leads and engage customers across various platforms, maximizing your marketing potential while adhering to individual platform guidelines.

By following these guidelines and exploring Chatbotbuilder.ai's multi-channel capabilities, you can create effective drip campaigns that reach a wider audience and achieve your marketing goals.

<Note>
  While Chatbotbuilder.ai also supports the phone/voice channel, drip campaigns do not apply to phone calls, as they offer direct and immediate communication with your customers.
