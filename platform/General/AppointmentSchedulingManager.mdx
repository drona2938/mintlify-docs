The Appointment Scheduling Manager enables you to book and schedule appointments and meetings. This feature enables your business to let others know about available appointments, information which they can then use to book a time slot.

<Note>
  If you connect your **Google Calendar** or **Outlook calendar**, the appointment manager syncs your calendars to ensure there are no double bookings, and it sends automated confirmations and reminders to participants.

Follow this guide to get started with scheduling appointments.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create your Calendar Inside ChatbotBuilder**

    Go to **Marketing \> Appointment Scheduling** and click the **Add** button.

    The most important thing you should provide is your availability.

    ![Set Availability](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/150054265342/original/iI165JeyMBtaoYZHfHYjG9JaVVhks38alA.png?1710886620)

    Our system will automatically create the confirmation flow and reminder flow. If you want to edit the confirmation message and reminder message, go to flows and edit the flows related to your calendar.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Connect Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar (optional)**

    - **Google Calendar:** Go to **Settings \> Integration \> Google Calendar** and click the **Connect** button.
    - **Outlook Calendar:** Go to **Settings \> Integration \> Outlook Calendar** and click the **Connect** button.

    Once your calendar is connected, the appointment is automatically updated in your Calendar once a user schedules one. Also, we check your calendar events to avoid overbooking.

    <Info>
      Be sure to collect the user’s email address before the user schedules an appointment to automatically send the user a calendar invitation through email.

    **Share the scheduling link during the bot conversation**

    1. **Get the scheduling link** by going to **Marketing \> Appointment Scheduling** and clicking the three dots on the Calendar you want to share the scheduling link.

    2. **Use the scheduling link** as a button link for channels that support buttons that open a website. For channels that don’t support a button that opens a website link SMS channel, you can send the scheduling link as a TEXT message.
    3. **Share the scheduling link from the inbox**
       Sometimes, you may need to send the scheduling link to the user manually through the inbox.
       Click the Calendar Icon to send the scheduling link to the user.
