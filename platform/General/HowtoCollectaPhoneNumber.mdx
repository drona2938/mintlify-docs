When a user sends an **SMS** to your business phone number, the chatbot will automatically save the user's number. However, you can proactively ask your customers for their **phone numbers** from any channel and subsequently send them an SMS.

To initiate this process, ensure you have the user's phone number. If you lack this information, you can prompt users to provide their **phone numbers** using the "Get User Data" block. Save the obtained phone numbers into the "Phone" **system field** for future interactions, including sending SMS messages.
