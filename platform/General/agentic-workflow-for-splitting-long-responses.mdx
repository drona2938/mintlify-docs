### Introduction

This workflow is designed to:

1. Generate a long response in a structured JSON format using the **OpenAI: Generate text** action.
2. Split the response into smaller, more digestible parts using the **Get Data from JSON** action.
3. Present the split content as individual, sequential messages for a better user experience.

### Workflow Structure

An agentic workflow for splitting long messages includes:

1. **OpenAI: Generate text node:** Produces a structured JSON response where each key represents a smaller part of the overall message.
2. **Get Data from JSON action:** Extracts each section of the JSON response and maps it to individual variables.
3. **Send Messages nodes:** Sequentially displays each part of the message to avoid overwhelming the user with one long block of text.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure the OpenAI: Generate Text Node**

    1. Add an **OpenAI: Generate text** node to your workflow.
    2. In the **Custom Instructions/Prompt** section, instruct the AI to format its response as JSON with clearly defined parts. For example:

       ```json
       Please split your response into multiple parts as a JSON object, with keys like "part1", "part2", "part3", etc. Each part should contain concise information. Example format:
       {
         "part1": "This is the introduction...",
         "part2": "This is the detailed explanation...",
         "part3": "This is the conclusion..."
       }
       ```
    3. Save the AI-generated JSON response to a custom variable, such as `{{ai_json}}`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Use the Get Data from JSON Action to Extract Sections**

    1. Add the **Get Data from JSON** action immediately after the **OpenAI: Generate text** node.
    2. In the **JSON Data** field, reference the variable where the JSON response is stored (e.g., `{{ai_json}}`).
    3. Map each JSON key to custom variables:
       - `.part1` → `MessagePart1`
       - `.part2` → `MessagePart2`
       - `.part3` → `MessagePart3`
    4. Add as many mappings as needed to cover all the parts of the JSON response.

    **Example JSON:**

    ```json
    {
      "part1": "Step 1: Understand the basics of nutrition.",
      "part2": "Step 2: Include more vegetables in your meals.",
      "part3": "Step 3: Stay consistent with healthy eating habits."
    }
    ```

    **Mapped variables:**

    - `{{MessagePart1}}` → “Step 1: Understand the basics of nutrition.”
    - `{{MessagePart2}}` → “Step 2: Include more vegetables in your meals.”
    - `{{MessagePart3}}` → “Step 3: Stay consistent with healthy eating habits.”
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Display the Extracted Sections as Split Messages**

    1. Add **Send Messages** nodes to display the extracted sections sequentially.
    2. Insert each mapped variable into separate messages:
       - First message: `{{MessagePart1}}`
       - Typing delay
       - Second message: `{{MessagePart2}}`
       - Typing delay
       - Third message: `{{MessagePart3}}`

    This approach ensures that each part of the response is displayed as an individual message, breaking up the long content for clarity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Validate JSON Structure">
    Ensure the AI consistently generates valid JSON by providing clear and explicit prompts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Typing Delays">
    Add slight typing delays between messages to make the interaction feel natural.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handle Varying Lengths">
    If the number of parts varies, create fallback logic or extra mappings to handle additional or missing sections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Thoroughly">
    Run tests with varied inputs to ensure the splitting logic works consistently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Example Workflow

**User Input:**

“Can you explain the steps to improve focus and productivity?”

**AI JSON Output:**

```json
{
  "part1": "Step 1: Set clear and achievable goals.",
  "part2": "Step 2: Minimize distractions by creating a focused workspace.",
  "part3": "Step 3: Use techniques like the Pomodoro method to stay productive.",
  "part4": "Step 4: Take breaks to avoid burnout and maintain focus."
}
```

**Displayed Output:**

1. **Message 1:** Step 1: Set clear and achievable goals.
2. **Message 2:** Step 2: Minimize distractions by creating a focused workspace.
3. **Message 3:** Step 3: Use techniques like the Pomodoro method to stay productive.
4. **Message 4:** Step 4: Take breaks to avoid burnout and maintain focus.

### Conclusion

This agentic workflow effectively splits long responses into smaller, user-friendly messages, ensuring clarity and engagement. By using structured JSON parsing, you can control how information is presented, delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience.
