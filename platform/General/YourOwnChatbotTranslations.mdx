Customizing your bot is a great way to make it uniquely yours\!

In the settings section, you can tweak the bot's content, default settings, and e-commerce flows to match your preferences and language.

This feature allows you to create a Messenger bot in any language that Facebook supports. To learn how to make these customizations, check out our step-by-step guide in this knowledge-based article.

Let's get started\! First, head over to the **Menu \> Settings \> Customizations**. Right at the top of the list, you'll see the 'Translations field.

Now, it's time to add your translations to the bot. We'll use a .csv spreadsheet for this and don't worry, we've got a default template ready for you. You can simply replace the content with your preferred language and then upload it back onto our platform.

Getting the default spreadsheet is easy\! Just go to the 'Translation' field description, like you see in the image above. From there, you can make a copy for yourself. You have two options: you can edit it directly online or download the sheet, make your changes, and then upload it back to our platform.

Remember, when you download the spreadsheet, make sure it's in .csv format, just like in the image below. Then, update the 'Text' column with your language content, and simply upload the file back using the 'upload file' button on the platform.
