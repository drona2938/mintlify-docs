Triggers and Actions help your bot activate actions when certain events occur in your bot. If something happens in your Messenger bot, it will make the bot do a specific action through automation.

You can use these rules to make tasks happen automatically, such as:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tag-Based Automation">
    If you give a tag to a user, add them to a special group on Facebook.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Engagement-Based Automation">
    When a user clicks on your email, sign them up for a series of messages on Messenger.
  </Card>
  <Card title="E-commerce Automation">
    If someone places a new order, tell the administrators through email or text message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Field Automation">
    If the value of a Custom Field changes, notify the administrator.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To make your own special rule, go to **Menu \> Marketing Tools \> Automation Rules** and click **"Add"** to create a new one.

The table below the “Add” button will show you the details of every rule which you had created and its status whether it is active or not.

You can also rename, move to folder or delete the rules by selecting the 3 dots located next to the rule name in the table.

Now, pick a name for your new rule in the "Add New" popup. Just choose a name you like for this automation. The popup will look something like this:
