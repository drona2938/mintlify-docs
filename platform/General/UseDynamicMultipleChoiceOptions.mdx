Dynamic Multiple Choice empowers your bot to engage users with questions and generate options in real time. It achieves this by fetching data from **APIs** or **Google Sheets**. This feature proves invaluable for businesses aiming to craft quizzes or pose qualifying questions to potential leads.

To create Dynamic Multiple Choice, you use the **Get User Data** action.

The reply type should be **Multiple Choice**. All your options must be stored in a single custom field.

#### 2 – Array of options (From API)

`["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Berry", "Melon"]`

You can use our External Request feature to get data from any API and use response mapping to extract the data you need. In the response below, you use response mapping to save the data to the custom field that is used to store the options.

```json
{
  "data": ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Berry", "Melon"]
}
```

#### 3 - Check what option the user chose.

Use Condition to check what option the user chose.
