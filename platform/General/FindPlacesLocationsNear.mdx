### Find categories of locations (Advanced use case)

It is possible to add many types of locations to a single bot and allow your contacts to find a specific category of location near them. For instance, you can add restaurants, Conference Centres, and ATMs to a single bot and allow your contacts to select what type of location they are looking for. For such a case, you should create a category and associate each location with a category.
