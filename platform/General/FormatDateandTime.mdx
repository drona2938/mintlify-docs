Formatting date and time will be useful for anyone who has customers in multiple nations and regions. Because the date & time format is not the same in every place. You can change the format of the date & time to your needs.

Follow the steps below to learn how to format the date and time for your convenience:

<Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Now select the option on the builder to:**

    - Select the date custom field that contains the date you want to format.
    - On the next field enter the format of the date and time you need to change from the default (For example, if you want to display the date and time as “23-01-2022; 02-00 a.m” then you need to enter the format field (without quotation) as “d-m-Y; h-i a”. Refer the table below to know more about the parameters).
    - Then, create a new custom field or select the existing one to store the changed date & time format on the “Save the formatted date to” field.
    - In addition, you can choose the time zone of this formatted date & time for the page (or) the user’s time zone.

| U         | Seconds since the Unix Epoch                                  | This format is very important because it allows you to get the date as total of seconds. With seconds you can do a lot of maths. For example a quiz bot would save the start date a user starts the quiz and also save the date the user finishes the quiz. The bot would calculate the total minutes the user takes to finish the quiz with `({{stop}} – {{start}})/60`. |
