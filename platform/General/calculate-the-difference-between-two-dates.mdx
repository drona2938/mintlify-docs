### Introduction

Calculating the difference between two dates is a common requirement in chatbot applications. For instance, in reservation bots, you may need to determine the number of days between a customer's check-in and check-out dates. This guide will walk you through the steps to compute the difference between two dates, or between a specific date and the current date, using Chatbot Builder AI.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Chatbot Builder AI.
- Understanding of custom fields and variables in Chatbot Builder AI.

### Steps Overview

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Collect the Dates:** Obtain the two dates you wish to compare.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Convert Dates to Seconds:** Transform the dates into total seconds since the Unix epoch.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Store in Custom Fields:** Save the converted seconds in number-type custom fields.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Calculate the Difference:** Subtract the earlier date from the later one.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Convert Seconds to Days:** Divide the difference by 86,400 to get days.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Display the Result:** Present the calculated days to the user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 1: Collect the Dates

First, ensure that you have collected the two dates you want to compare. These dates can be user-provided dates (e.g., check-in and check-out dates).

### Step 2: Convert Dates to Total Number of Seconds

To calculate the difference between two dates, you need to convert each date into a numerical format representing the total number of seconds since January 1, 1970 (the Unix epoch).

#### Conversion Process

<Steps>
  <Step>
    In the Flow Builder, add a new block.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select: **'Add Content' \> 'Actions' \> 'Tools' \> 'Format Date'**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Configure the Check-In Date:**

    - Under **Date & Time**, select the custom field with the first date, such as the `'check_in_date'` custom field.
    - In the **Format** field, enter `'"U"'` to format the date as seconds since the Unix epoch.
    - Choose a new custom field, such as `'check_in_seconds'`, to save the formatted date.
    - Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Repeat for the Check-Out Date:** Follow the same steps to format `'check_out_date'` into seconds, saving it to a new custom field, such as `'check_out_seconds'`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This setup allows you to perform arithmetic calculations on the two date fields, enabling accurate difference calculations in seconds.

### Step 3: Store the Converted Seconds in Custom Number Fields

Create custom number fields to store the total seconds for each date:

- `'check_in_seconds'`: Stores the total seconds for the check-in date.
- `'check_out_seconds'`: Stores the total seconds for the check-out date.

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Seconds

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Add a New Action:** In the Flow Builder, click on **'Actions' \> 'Set Custom Field'**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Calculate the Difference:**

    - Under **Operation**, choose **'Set to'**.
    - In the **Value** field, enter the formula to calculate the difference in seconds: `'{{check_out_seconds}} - {{check_in_seconds}}'`.
    - Save the result in a new custom number field, such as `'difference_in_seconds'`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 5: Convert Seconds to Days

To convert the difference from seconds to days:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Add Another Action:** In the Flow Builder, click on **'Actions' \> 'Set Custom Field'**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Calculate the Difference in Days:**

    - Under **Operation**, choose **'Set to'**.
    - In the **Value** field, enter the formula: `'{{difference_in_seconds}} / 86400'`.
    - Save the result in a custom number field, such as `'difference_in_days'`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Why Divide by 86,400?

This formula converts the time difference from seconds into days, based on the number of seconds in one day:

- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour
- 24 hours = 1 day

So,

`'60 * 60 * 24 = 86,400'` seconds per day.

Dividing by 86,400 gives the exact number of days between the check-in and check-out dates.

### Step 6: Output the Result

Use the `'difference_in_days'` field to inform the user of the number of days between the two dates.

**Example:**

> Your stay is for {difference_in_days} nights.
