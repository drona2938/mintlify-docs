Utilizing a custom domain enables a business to leverage its own branded domain for webchat, e-commerce, appointment scheduling, omnichannel links, landing pages, and bot extensions like Get User Data. This instills greater trust as clients observe your brand domain rather than the Chatbot Builder domain.

<Note>
  It's essential to note that the dashboard domain will persist on the Chatbot Builder or Whitelabel domain. However, **this domain exclusively impacts client-interacting features**. If you're interested in Whitelabeling the Chatbot Builder dashboard, refer to our documentation. The documentation is valid for our Whitelabel clients, and they have to follow as instructed.
</Note>

### Costs

Please check with the support team on current pricing.

### How to set up

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Generate a subdomain, such as `app.mydomain.com`, within the DNS settings of your domain manager. Establish an A record directing to the IP address **34.117.54.182**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    If you are unfamiliar with adjusting DNS settings, contact your domain provider's support for assistance.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Typically, your subdomain becomes accessible online in under 1 hour. However, please be aware that the full propagation of your new configuration across the internet may take up to 24 hours.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Custom domain works with external client-facing links. These are:

1. Published web-chat links
2. Published landing page links
